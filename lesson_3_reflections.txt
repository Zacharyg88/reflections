Q1 - When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A1 - It makes much more sense to use a remote repository when you may be working from multiple locations, multiple computers, or if 
you are collaborating with other developers. This way, you always have the most up to date information in the repository.
Q2 - Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A2 - Automatic updates will probably cause redundant or extraneous "pulls" that are just not necessary and will clutter our git log.
git 
Q3 - Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A3 - Forks are just clones that only exist on GitHub, and are made by
GitHub. A Clone is a copy of a repository that can exist both locally and on GitHub, and branches are deviations or seperate versions of the 
same repository in order to workshop or trial run specific pieces of code.
Q4 - What is the benefit of havina a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
A4 - Without a locally stored copy, we would be unable to accurately
update our code without internet access. So long as we have the most
up to date copy stored locally, we can work without consequence offline.
